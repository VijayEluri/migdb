### About Database Migration
The vision of our project is to create a system which transforms the database model (and the database itself) on the basis of changes in the application model and that without loss of any data in the database (all at full operation).

From the one point of view, it is actually a automatization (evolution) of the object-relational mapping (The object-relational mapping is a common software development approach, which can speed up the creation of software).

Nowadays there are a lot of software applications, which are created using object-relation mapping (ORM), this approach speeds up the development a lot, on the other hand most of current ORM frameworks focus only at software creation, not on software evolution.
