### About

There are a lot of software applications, which are using object-relation mapping (ORM), this approach speeds up the development a lot, on the other hand most of the current ORM frameworks focus only at software creation, not on software evolution.

The goal of our project is to create a framework which evolves the entities (objects) and the database (schema and data) without loss of any information stored in the database. We call our approach extended ORM.
